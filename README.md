# Stormpath is Joining Okta
We are incredibly excited to announce that [Stormpath is joining forces with Okta](https://stormpath.com/blog/stormpaths-new-path?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement). Please visit [the Migration FAQs](https://stormpath.com/oktaplusstormpath?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm-campaign=okta-announcement) for a detailed look at what this means for Stormpath users.

## Migration guide

For specific guidance on what this means for ASP.NET Core users of Stormpath, see the [migration guide](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-dotnet-owin-middleware/blob/master/migrating.md).

## ASP.NET Core Example Project

This project has been updated to use the Okta-compatible middleware packages (4.0.0+). If you want to migrate an existing Stormpath-backed ASP.NET application to Okta, you can use this project as an example.

For an example of how to use the OpenID Connect Code Flow with Okta (without the legacy Stormpath libraries), see Lee's blog post on [using OpenID Connect with ASP.NET Core](https://okta.github.io/blog/2017/06/29/oidc-user-auth-aspnet-core).

We're available to answer all questions at [developers@okta.com](mailto:developers@okta.com).
